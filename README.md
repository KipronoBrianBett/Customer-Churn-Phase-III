# Customer-Churn-Phase-III

SyriaTel Customer Churn Prediction
ðŸš€ A data-driven approach to predicting and reducing customer churn at SyriaTel using machine learning.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Customer churn is a major concern for telecom companies, leading to revenue loss and high customer acquisition costs. This project builds a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn, helping SyriaTel implement proactive retention strategies.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: SyriaTel Customer Data
Features Include:
Numerical: Total minutes, Total calls, Total charges
Categorical: Contract type, Payment method, International plan
Target: Churn (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Churn Rate: 14.5% of customers churned (imbalanced dataset).
Key Findings:
High usage (minutes, charges) â†’ Higher churn risk.
Frequent customer service calls â†’ Indicator of dissatisfaction.
Longer account length â†’ More stable customers.
